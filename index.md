# What is an exsitential risk

An exsitential risk is a massive risk that comes from an outside force that could cause massive devistation examples of this is a Nuclear Bomb or a astroid impact hitting the earth these events can some times be mitigated by an outside force or events like a astroid impact cannot be stopped.

# What is A.I.
A.I. Is called Artifical Intelligence and it is used in computer systems and it helps them think more like humans. Over the years A.I. started off quite small and not very smart but as the years went on and we got access to more powerful technology A.I. has become alot smarter by being able to reconstruct our faces perfectly or by solving complex maths equations in record breaking time.
